# QiPress Readme #
----------

 1. This is the portable version of QiPress that is tested to run on Windows 10 64-bit and should also run flawlessly on 64-bit Windows 7 and 8.1. Please note that Windows 32-bit is no longer supported.
 2. It is preferable to extract the portable file(s) in a directory of its own (maybe name it QiPress), so that the portable files don't mix with your existing files.
 3. Download the zip only from trust-worthy sources. If in doubt, use your Virus Scanner.
 4. If you are running the app for the first time on your PC, and Windows Defender prevents it from running because it does not recognize it, you can click "Run anyway". It may also help if you run the app with Admin rights (Right-Click on the exe File > Properties > Compatibility > Run this program as an administrator > OK).
 5. All implementations have been made to make it a very safe application. However, because the application requires keyboard hooks (it needs to detect them first to be able to display them), some anti-virus software flag it. All I can note here is that the app stores no keystrokes anywhere, nor does it send it using any network connections. You should be able to verify this using disk and network monitors.
